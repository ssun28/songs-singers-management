## Application Name
Songs/Singers Management

## Brief Description
Usually, if a person wants to post a song or become a singer, he/she needs to sign a record company. 
With the development of blockchain technology, everyone can post your own song and become the singer without signing a record company. 
Your songs will be recorded in the blockchain network. The copyright of the song will be only own by the singer himself/herself 
instead of the record company, which is called distributing Copyrights.

## What:
Decentralized record company

## Why:
Most of the time, the copyright of the song is controlled by the record company. Also, some people lie about the sources of the songs 
and may plagiarize someone else’s ideas. With the blockchain technology, people put everything about the song into the blockchain, 
which is immutable. And since the blockchain is public, everyone in the blockchain can see the songs’ information and people can prove 
the copyright of the songs by its owner.

## How:
Singers post their songs in the blockchain. People pay for tokens to listen to music. Since music is a pure fan-driven industry, 
singers also can spend tokens letting fans advertise the songs to more people, for example, fan A may have 10 followers or 10 people 
in the peersList, fan B may have 1,000 followers or 1,000 people in the peersList, fan B should get more tokens from the singers in 
helping to advertise the songs since fan B is more influential. Or the singer can give the token holders 20 percent of the song's future earnings. 
In this way, we use the feature of token to reflect these originally soft values, since the token can be divided into very very small pieces. 
Furthermore, fans can raise money to let their idols post new songs. 

## Functionalities/Success
